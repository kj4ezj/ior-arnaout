## Prerequisites
Your Linux user account must be in the `dialout` user group to flash the board over the virtual serial port. If you are not already, add yourself to this group...
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```
...then restart for the changes to take effect.

## Setup
This is an Arduino-compatible board.
1. Install the [Arduino IDEv2](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide).
    ```bash
    flatpak install -y cc.arduino.IDE2
    ```
1. Add the ESP32-S3 board support package (BSP).
    1. Arduino IDEv2 > Tools > Board > Board Manager.
    1. Search "esp32".
    1. Install `esp32` by Espressif Systems.
1. Add the Adafruit ST7789 library for the little display.
    1. Arduino IDEv2 > Tools > Manage Libraries...
    1. Search "Adafruit_ST7789".
    1. Install `Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789` by Adafruit with dependencies.
1. Add the Adafruit RA8875 for the big display.
    1. Arduino IDEv2 > Tools > Manage Libraries...
    1. Search "RA8875".
    1. Install `Adafruit RA8875` by Adafruit with dependencies.

## Flashing
Plug the board into your computer and open the Arduino IDE. Then:
1. Verify the correct board is set.  
    Tools > Board > esp32 > Adafruit Feather ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT
1. Verify the correct port is set.  
    Tools > Port > `/dev/ttyACM0`, or whatever serial port your board was assigned.
1. Enter download mode.  
    Hold down the `D0` button on the board, press the `Reset` button, then release `D0`.
1. Program the board.  
    You can hit the right arrow button in the top-left of the Arduino IDE, or use Sketch > Upload.

The board [will](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues/6762) reset automatically running the new code.
